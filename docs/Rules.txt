Start of each level:
1) A sequence of n integers x1,x2,x3...,xn will be displayed.
2) Based on the given sequence, the player must tell if it is possible if there exists an arithmetic expression that yields X any combination of {+,-,*,/} is placed between elements of the sequence.
3) A corect answer will allow the user to proceed to the next level while a wrong answer stops the game.
4) The total amount of time it took the player to answer the level correctly is recorded.
5) High scores will be based on number of levels solved and time.

*n=5
*x=42
*Tingin nyo dpaat retain natin yung divide na operator?
*Yung arithmetic expression ay solved from left to right (ignored yung opertor precedence)
*To prevent cheating, kapag nag navigate yung user away sa game dapat pagresume iba na yung sequnce tapos reset timer nalang?
